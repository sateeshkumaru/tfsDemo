I need to demo wiremock docker image by using an vehicle app. need to create two endpoint create owner and get owner. owner contains ownerId, licenseNumber, postalCode, name. while creating need to validate postal code by calling an external api which needs to be mocked, then save the reposne using in internal api. second endpoint also get the data from seond internal api.   need to write karate component tests to validate this. Mocking should be doe using wiremock docker imge

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set up your vehicle app demo using WireMock (Docker) for mocking the external API and Karate for component testing.

🔧 Application Overview
Entities
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "ownerId": "UUID",
  "licenseNumber": "string",
  "postalCode": "string",
  "name": "string"
}
📌 Functionality
Endpoint 1: POST /owners
Validates postalCode using an external API (GET /validate-postal/{postalCode})

If valid, saves owner data via internal API (POST /internal/owners)

Returns success/failure

Endpoint 2: GET /owners/{ownerId}
Retrieves data from an internal API (GET /internal/owners/{ownerId})

🐳 Step 1: WireMock Docker Setup

    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./wiremock:/home/wiremock

@PostMapping("/owners")
public ResponseEntity<?> createOwner(@RequestBody OwnerDto owner) {
    boolean isValid = externalApiService.validatePostalCode(owner.getPostalCode());
    if (!isValid) return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body("Invalid postal code");
    internalOwnerService.save(owner);
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Owner created");
}

@GetMapping("/owners/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<OwnerDto> getOwner(@PathVariable String id) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(internalOwnerService.findById(id));
}

✅ Run Steps
Start WireMock:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up -d
Run your Spring Boot app (make sure it points to http://localhost:8081 for postal validation).

Execute Karate tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dkarate.options="classpath:demo/owners/create-owner.feature"
Would you like me to generate:

Java model and service classes?

A prebuilt stub setup for WireMock with multiple postal codes?

A Gradle/Maven-based test runner for Karate?

Let me know how deep you want to go.

You said:
also mock the internal api
ChatGPT said:
Great! You want to mock both the external API (postal code validation) and the internal API (for saving and retrieving owners) using WireMock inside a Docker container, and use Karate to write component tests that validate the whole flow.

📘 Spring Boot Config Tips
In application.yml, point your services to the WireMock container:

yaml
Copy
Edit
external-api:
  base-url: http://localhost:8081
internal-api:
  base-url: http://localhost:8081
✅ Summary
✅ WireMock Docker now mocks both external (postal code) and internal (save/get owner) APIs.

✅ Karate tests validate that the app correctly handles the full create + get flow using those mocks.

✅ Minimal Spring Boot config changes to redirect service calls to WireMock.

Would you like me to generate:

The full Spring Boot service classes for this?

A sample docker-compose.yml with both app and WireMock?

Karate test runner class (Java)?

Let me know what you want next.
